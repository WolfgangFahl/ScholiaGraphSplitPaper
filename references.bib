	abstract = {Across essentially all fields of research, many aspects of the respective research processes – whether experimental, theoretical, empirical or outright computational – are closely related to software. Yet the process of finding software that is directly suitable or at least a good starting point for a given research task is cumbersome.This project aims to develop a community-driven system that provides potential users of research software with a diversity of pathways towards actually finding software that closely matches their research needs if such software exists. Conversely, it will provide software developers with mechanisms to make their software findable for research-related tasks and it will highlight mismatches between software supply and demand for specific tasks.To this end, we will document how various stakeholders of the research landscape have been searching for – or stumbling upon – research software so far, identify variables associated with successful search outcomes and build workflows that assist in describing software and associated concepts in a standardised fashion. These descriptions will then be aligned across various sources of relevant information and integrated into Wikidata, the knowledge graph that anyone can edit and that already contains considerable breadth and depth of information related to research, software and their interactions.While keeping an eye on similar approaches to software discovery that might work in parts of the research ecosystem, existing Wikidata content and workflows will be reviewed and built upon. Additional documentation, tooling and workflows will be developed to enrich, expand, curate, query and explore this content, both for specific use cases and with ongoing engagement of the communities involved in research software, open data or collaborative curation. Within its three years, the project seeks to establish a dedicated community overseeing a well-documented and smoothly running infrastructure for software discovery and to devise a plan for how this can be sustained for the longer term.},

	volume = {11},

	abstract = {Water is vital for life on Earth, but aquatic environments worldwide are facing critical challenges that cause severe problems for biodiversity and human well-being. These challenges include, for example, water pollution, habitat degradation, escalating water and air temperatures, salinisation of freshwaters, ocean acidification and invasive species. Since these stressors interact in complex ways, developing predictions and mitigation measures is difficult. Mesocosm experiments, offering controlled, yet realistic settings, are crucial for understanding and mitigating the impact of various stressors and their combinations on aquatic ecosystems. Mesocom facilities are key Research Infrastructures (RI), as they bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and natural systems allowing studies of highly complex environments comparable to natural ecosystems, while still offering controlled and replicated settings not available in natural systems.The AQUACOSM-RI consortium, comprising over 60 individual state-of-the-art mesocosm facilities at 28 host institutions across Europe, has therefore been instrumental in advancing aquatic environmental research across climate zones including marine, brackish and freshwater ecosystems. In addition, the EU H2020-INFRAIA projects AQUACOSM (CORDIS No. 731065) and AQUACOSM-plus (CORDIS No. 871081, www.aquacosm.eu) have developed a virtual network beyond Europe of presently &gt; 85 host institutions with &gt; 120 aquatic mesocosm facilities around the world, www.mesocosm.org. However, the rich, yet disconnected resources in aquatic mesocosm-based experimental research and mitigation approaches need to be combined in a modern, visible and accessible way.The project AQUANAVI (Navigating Grand Challenges and their Mitigation using Aquatic Experimental RIs) aims to enhance existing efforts by creating an interactive atlas of aquatic mesocosm facilities and related mesocosm-based experimental research. Integrating data, publications, reports and information on mesocosm facility capacities generated by the AQUACOSM consortium and other mesocosm facilities in Europe and beyond, AQUANAVI will facilitate fast discovery of resources and unused potentials of available mesocosm facilities in a modern, visible and accessible way that is presently not available. Such a multidimensional tool is expected to enable novel collaborations and a much faster setup and execution of connected and/or distributed experiments and efficient development of environmental mitigation strategies. Built upon the AQUACOSM-RIs and their encompassing data and information repository as well as scientific and technical competence, while also leveraging related infrastructures like AnaEE, EMBRC, JERICO-RI and eLTER, AQUANAVI will provide a comprehensive resource platform to more effectively explore available resources for aquatic experimental research.AQUANAVI will bridge this wealth of scientific data, expertise and mesocosm facility information through Hi Knowledge, an innovative analysis and visualisation platform that merges Wikidata, Open Knowledge Maps,and Scholia. Hi Knowledge harnesses the semantic capabilities of Wikidata to rapidly construct a FAIR and open corpus for a domain, based on a sophisticated conceptual classification system. Subsequently, Hi Knowledge incorporates visualisation components from Open Knowledge Maps and Scholia, allowing researchers to smoothly navigate information using cutting-edge visualisation techniques, artificial intelligence and knowledge synthesis methods.Open and collaborative by design, AQUANAVI’s architecture will engage a broad range of research communities. By consolidating data and information from diverse RIs, the platform will leverage and enhance the AQUACOSM and related research infrastructures, securing the reusability and interoperability of existing data collections and better exploration of existing RIs in the future. Compliant with FAIR principles and EOSC requirements, AQUANAVI will ensure the long-term sustainability and openness of its resources, enriching both the ENVRI services portfolio and the broader scientific community. In summary, AQUANAVI will empower researchers and stakeholders to implement measures to mitigate the effects of climate change and other Grand Challenges facing aquatic environments, serving as a key resource within and beyond the European research area.},
